# Ignite - [Live Site](https://fierce-sands-31159.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Maintaining a strong and healthy relationship can be a challenge when life gets busy, and as we grow and change as individuals. We created Ignite to help couples connect, communicate, and find new ways to make one another feel loved. <br />

Users will have access to a 'Question of the Day' that will spark conversation and allow for a deeper understanding of one another. Each partner will complete a questionnaire that will determine the primary way in which they feel loved. Once complete, a list will be displayed with ways for each partner to make the other feel more loved, based on their individual love language.
